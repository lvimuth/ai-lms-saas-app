We will cover techniques that go beyond the basics, enabling you to build more complex and sophisticated software systems.</p>\n\n<h4>Metaclasses: Understanding and using metaclasses for class customization</h4>\n<p>This section explores metaclasses, which are classes whose instances are classes. Learn how to use metaclasses to modify class behavior, customize class creation, and add functionality at the class level.  Topics include: defining metaclasses, using <code>type</code>, and advanced metaclass applications.</p>\n\n<h4>Abstract Base Classes (ABCs): Defining interfaces and enforcing contracts</h4>\n<p>Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) provide a way to define interfaces and enforce contracts between classes.  This section covers the use of the <code>abc</code> module, defining abstract methods, and implementing abstract methods in subclasses.  We will also discuss the benefits of using ABCs for improved code organization and maintainability.</p>\n\n<h4>Design Patterns: Advanced patterns (e.g., Decorator, Facade, Command), and their implementation in Python</h4>\n<p>This section focuses on implementing several advanced design patterns in Python. We will cover the Decorator pattern (adding functionality dynamically), the Facade pattern (simplifying complex systems), and the Command pattern (encapsulating requests as objects).  Each pattern's implementation will be explained with clear examples and use cases.</p>\n\n<h4>Dependency Injection: Implementing dependency injection for improved testability and maintainability</h4>\n<p>Dependency Injection is a crucial technique for improving code testability and maintainability. Learn how to decouple classes by injecting dependencies rather than creating them internally.  This section will cover various approaches to dependency injection, including constructor injection, setter injection, and interface injection.  The benefits of each approach and best practices will be discussed.</p>\n\n<h4>SOLID Principles: Applying SOLID principles for designing modular and extensible code</h4>\n<p>This section introduces the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion) as guidelines for designing robust and maintainable object-oriented systems.  We will explore how to apply these principles in practice to create more flexible and extensible codebases.  Examples will illustrate how violating these principles can lead to problems.</p>\n\n<h4>Testing strategies for OOP: Unit testing, integration testing, mocking</h4>\n<p>Effective testing is critical for ensuring the quality of object-oriented code. This section covers different testing strategies, including unit testing (testing individual components), integration testing (testing the interaction between components), and mocking (simulating dependencies for testing).  We will examine best practices for writing effective tests and using testing frameworks such as <code>unittest</code> or <code>pytest</code>.</p>\n```\n"},
